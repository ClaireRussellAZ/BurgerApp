# BurgerApp

This "Burger App" takes a different theme of villagers (as the ingredients of your burger) moving into your town (the burger).
You decide whether or not to move them out! You can even delete their existance permanently.

Using the "burger's name," (villagers name) this app will move in villager on the database. 
This uses Express, body pharsing, ORM and mysql to run it's databasing and routing.
